# DomoticAI
## Domotic AI is an IoT-based voice automation system that enables hands-free control of smart devices
* This project uses the **seeed studio xiao esp32s3 (sense)** and leverages machine learning with **Edge Impulse** to recognize voice commands, allowing users to control devices through simple spoken instructions.
* The project is integrated with the **Arduino IDE** for seamless command processing and device interaction.
### Key Features
* **Voice-activated device control**: Utilize voice commands to operate smart home devices, such as lights
  through the ESP32-S3.
* **Machine learning integration**: Edge Impulse-trained models provide accurate voice recognition, offering 
  reliable command execution.
* **Real-time data logging**: All the devices connected,actions  are logged and a dedicated website displays these logs, to provide 
  insight into system interactions and device states.

  
#### This project showcases the capabilities of AI-driven voice automation in IoT, focusing on user convenience and smart home functionality.
